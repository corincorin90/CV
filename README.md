## Skills

**Problem Solving**

Having studied physics to masters level I have developed the ability to analyse complex technical problems and provide solutions to difficult experimental challenges. I have also worked in a technical support role which required me to quickly pick up new coding languages and technologies so that I could support teams in the business to diagnose and resolve issues. I've worked with the challenges of automating manual processes, refactoring legacy code to provide more efficient solutions. I have since studied new technologies at an intense coding bootcamp, building and designing projects from scratch and providing quick resolutions to problems affecting team projects, I particularly enjoy working with database configuration and setup, and have a keen interest in back end technologies.

**Independent Learning**

The most important thing I have learnt so far is how to learn. As a scientist, I believe in the search for knowledge, and have an insatiable curiosity when it comes to learning new skills. As a programmer I have learnt to become a knowledge worker, and have discovered that what matters more than what you know is being inquisitive, to have drive, and to know how to find information when it's needed.

**Collaboration & Communication**

During my time at Makers Academy I have spent a significant amount of time working on group projects, collaborating across small and large teams working towards shared goals. I have appreciated the value of working in an agile way, implementing daily standups, code reviews and weekly retros to facilitate shared learning and improve communication. I have spent much of my time pair programming, and have learnt effective communication skills and how to deliver constructive feedback through employing XP values.
